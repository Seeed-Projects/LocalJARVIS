# LocalJARVIS Project (üößWIPüöß)

This project takes off with the Application Engineers at Seeed Studio embarking on a journey to leverage the advanced capabilities of the Jetson Orin AGX. Our mission is to deploy it for the operation of a Local Large Language Model (LLM) embedded with a Langchain agent. The objective is to evolve our office environment into a cutting-edge, GenAI-infused AIoT workspace, further enhanced by the integration of automation with the Home Assistant project. The goal is to establish an open-source framework based on RAG for building a local LLM that interacts with Home Assistant API. This endeavor seeks not only to elevate the workplace atmosphere but also to decrease energy consumption, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

This comprehensive project is divided into several crucial segments, each indispensable for the effective real-world deployment of this groundbreaking upgrade.

Here is the flowchart of the whole system:

</p>

1. Voice Input: Users engage with the system by initiating conversations via ReSpeaker.
2. Voice Processing: The ReSpeaker sends these commands to NVIDIA¬Æ Riva software component that recognizes speech (ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition), NVIDIA¬Æ Riva is the speech multilingual speech and translation AI software development kit developed by Nvidia, this Nvidia Riva service is running locally on the Nvidia Jetson devices, in this case we are uing a powerfull Orin AGX . After recognizing the speech and Riva turns it into input prompts for further processing.
3. Local Processing or Cloud Processing: The input can be processed locally using a server called Jetson Orin AGX, or it can be sent to the cloud through OpenAI's API for language understanding and response generation(to be noted: We maintain the use of OpenAI API for its significantly better performance and accuracy over the locally-run llama-2-7b models. Nonetheless, our ultimate aim is to transition to a fully local setup. We are confident in our ability to enhance the performance of local LLMs to achieve this objective.)
4. Decision Making:
   * If the input requires controlling tools, it goes to through a LangChain process, which decides if an action needs to be taken (like turning on a light).</br>
    For example:</br>
        User: Hi Javis!</br> 
        Agent: bla bla bla</br>
    
   * If no action is needed, it proceeds to generate a response directly.
5. Home Automation Interaction: If an action is needed, LangChain agent communicates with Home Assistant through Home Assistant API to control and  perform the task on smart appliances (These are the devices being controlled by the system, like lights, thermostats, or any other connected smart home devices, the action will for example be turn on off the lights, control the smart thermostat, set a to-do task, or even orders things from the online shop(amazon, aliexpress) and etc
6. Feedback: The system provides feedback of the states of the executes a control action.
7. Display Information: Display the information via Node-RED, like the current state of home entities (like temperature sensors), time, or weather reports, etc.
